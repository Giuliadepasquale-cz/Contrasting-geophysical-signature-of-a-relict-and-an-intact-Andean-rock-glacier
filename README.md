This repository contains the data and 4 phase inversion code implemented in the paper
Note that the code for the 4PM inversion is modified from the pubblic available one from Wagner, F., Mollaret, C., Günther, T., Kemna, A., and Hauck, C.: Quantitative imaging of water, ice and air in permafrost systems through petrophysical joint inversion of seismic refraction and electrical resistivity data, Geophys. J. Int., 219, 1866–1875, 2019.
